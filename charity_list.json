We hope to help many more with your support. \n\n \n\nIt is hard to understand how these children end up with no-one. Sometimes parents die or are imprisoned or fall ill; sometimes children flee homes due to violence or abuse; sometimes children become part of a gang; there are many reasons. Such children are often viewed at best as a nuisance and at worst as a danger to public safety. Violence against them is common place, and the only way of surviving is through begging, prostitution and crime. \n\n \n\nIt is the aim of Children of Bahia to help to look after and educate as many children as we can over the coming years, to help guide them into a brighter future full of love and support. \n\n \n\nAll our UK staff are un-paid volunteers and over 95% of all donations get to Brazil to help the children directly.
